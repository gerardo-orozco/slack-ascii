# slack-ascii

> STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS

Because sometimes emoji just won't do it! Try `slack-ascii` and bring your
own ASCII emoticons to your Slack team!

## Demo

> Add some demo gif here

## Usage

- Type `/ascii <keyword>` on any channel, group or DM and a message will be
posted on your behalf with the requested ASCII emoticon (no spam at all,
I promise, check the source).
- Run `/ascii help` to see the avilable emoticons.
- Use `/ascii usage` to see a short description of other available commands to
manage your emoticons right from Slack.

## Installation

Installation requires you to do a few things:

- Get a _Slack Web API token_ for your team for `slack-ascii` to post on your behalf.
- Create a _Slash Command_ integration to trigger `slack-ascii`
- Configure and deploy this app; we will use [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) here,
but you can host it anywhere you want.

First click the button below. That will open a new tab in Heroku to start configuring
this application for deployment. For now, keep that tab open, we will get back to it
later with the configuration values.

<a href="https://heroku.com/deploy" target="_blank">

</a>

### Getting a Slack Web API Token

- In a new tab, go to <https://api.slack.com/web>
- Scroll down to **Authentication**
- Click on `Create token` next to your team
- Copy your team's token and paste it into the Heroku app's **Config Variables**
for `SLACK_TEAM_API_TOKEN`
- You may close this tab now

### Create a Slash Command (part 1)

- In a new tab, go to your team's integrations page `https://<team>.slack.com/services/new`
- Scroll to the bottom of the page to the **DIY Integrations & Customizations** section
- Click on `View` next to **Slash Commands** and configure as follows in the
**Integration Settings** section:
  - Command: `/ascii`
  - URL: `https://<app-name>.herokuapp.com/` where <app-name> is the name generated by Heroku
  (we will get to that shortly)
  - Method: `POST`
  - Tick the **Show this command in the autocomplete list** checkbox in the
  **Autocomplete help text** section
  - Description: `Because sometimes emoji just won't do it`
  - Usage hint: `<keyword>`
  - Descriptive Label: `ASCII Emoticons for Slack`
- Leave this page open for now, we still have to get the Heroku app name.

### Deploying to Heroku

- Go back to the tab where you are configuring your Heroku app.
- Leave the `App Name` field blank, if you wish; Heroku will generate one for you if it's blank.
- Ensure all `SLACK_TEAM_API_TOKEN` is now populated
- Click on `Deploy for free`
- Once deployment has completed, the `App Name` field will be populated. Take a note of this.
Or if you chose your own name, take a note of that.
- You may close this tab now

### Create a Slash Command (part 2)

- Update the Slash Command's URL with the updated app name following the Heroku deployment.
- Click on `Save Integration` and close the tab.

OK! Now you are good to go! Go on, try `/ascii help` to use some preloaded emoticons.
And of course, you and your teammates can add your own and they will be available
for all the team!

## Development

After you have clonned this repo, to be able to try things locally, you will need to:

- Install PostgreSQL
- Create an empty database
- Set some environment variables

```bash
export SLACK_TEAM_API_TOKEN='your-team-api-token'
export DATABASE_URL='postgresql://username:password@host/database_name'
```

After meeting these requirements, you are good to start hacking!
